six steps

understand (30%)
  1. ask clarifying questions (do you understand the prompt)?
  2. Setup Sample I/O's/Identify edge cases

Plan (45%)
  3. identify approach(es) (what DSs combine to solve problems? Complexities?)
  4. Pseudocode (this is most important step)

Code (25%)
  5. Impliment your solution (code)

Test and analyze (100%)
  6. Test your I/Os and revisit Big-O Notation


Continue with DS/Algos Course on AA Open
Cracking the Coding Interview + Elements of Programming Interviews
Leetcode + HackerRank + codingbat + AlgoExpert + InterviewCake
Pramp: Practice live and often (2 time per week)  This one is very iffy unless you pay
Take notes, track and analyze your own practice & study - what techniques are you using? When do you use them?
  > how are other people solving these problems?
  > Are they using techniques that you're not familiar with?


Ask recruiters if they have any recommendations about what you can study to prepare
In coding challenges: do the bonus features.  They are never really bonuses.  Do them because someone else will!  Add additional functionality to the project if you have time.  It's a plue


If you can't review and optimize before submitting, continue to work on it after and send updated project with a thank you email.

knowledge/trivia questions

do you have a baseline understanding of various important subjects in web development

What is the event loop?  How does it work?
What happens when you enter a url into a browser and press enter?
What's the best and worst part about using Flask?
What is REST and what does it stand for?
Talk about the 4 types of positions in CSS?

what is xss and csrf and what are diffs between the two?


structure your responses
  don't rush

Prepping: understand every single line of code you write and know the curriculum


Whiteboarding strategies
bucketizing with a hash
dynamic programming
mathematical properties
keep two pointers for the same iteration
keep a stack or a queue on the side
perform an operation twice
sort the input
approach the problem from the other end
